Welcome to LC3 Tutor. This website has information to get you started building LC3 programs. The LC3 architecture is itself a tool for learning the basics of computing systems and is usually found in introductory computer engineering classes and these classes involve assignments that require LC3 assembly programming. This website is for those needing help with LC3 assignments or for those looking to self learn for their own reasons.

I have helped many students with LC3 assignments and as I get the time, I will throw that information up on this site.

I will be adding information little by little, so check back periodically!
