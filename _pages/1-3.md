This section goes over how to run a user created LC3 program.

These are the steps needed to run a program,

Have the proper LC3 assembly files along with PennSim working,
Assemble each assembly file to create a symbol and object file,
Load each object file,
Click or type the command for Continue.
If you donâ€™t know the commands then look over this section, [1.2. Basic Commands](/1-2/).

## 1. The Assembly Code:

In this first example there are two assembly files. The OS file and the user program. The OS file and at least one user program is needed to do anything useful. The LC3 OS code is provided and will rarely be edited. The user program code contains the functionality. There can be multiple user program files. The LC3 code is shown below.

{% include codesnip.html filename="lc3os.asm" %}

{% include codesnip.html filename="hello.asm" %}
